# Transaction Hedera app

## Inspiration 💡

Suppose A person wants to send money to B person. Then his transfer is represented as a block. Then Block is broadcasted to everyone in the network. Approved as valid by everyone in the network. Now when the Block is added to the providing an indelible and transparent Record of Transaction, so Now with our Web app Using Hashgraph, we Complete our transaction in no time. i.e., 10x Faster than Block Chain technology


## What it does ❓

The deployment of the Hedera Network Service in our project enables you to build applications that can handle a large volume of transactions with low latency and high throughput, providing a seamless and efficient experience for your users. The service offers a high transaction processing speed of 10,000+ transactions per second, allowing for multiple transactions to be processed in no time. The hashgraph algorithm ensures that transactions are processed in a fast, fair, and secure manner, providing reliable and efficient transaction processing for applications built on top of the Hedera Network Service. The Hedera Network Service, built on the hashgraph distributed consensus algorithm, provides a platform for deploying smart contracts and building applications with high throughput and low-latency consensus finality. It allows for the execution of transactions in seconds, providing instant transaction confirmation details through a transaction web app.

## How we built it ❓

- Deployed Hedera Network Service with smart contracts in our project to build an application that offers a high throughput and low-latency consensus finality in seconds.
- Developed a transaction web app that enables instant execution of transactions and provides real-time transaction confirmation details.
- Achieved a transaction processing speed of 10,000+ transactions per second, allowing for rapid processing of multiple transactions.
- Utilized the hashgraph distributed consensus algorithm, known for its fast, fair, and secure nature, to power the Hedera Network Service.
- Gained insights into leveraging distributed consensus algorithms for efficient transaction processing, optimizing user experience, and ensuring security and reliability in blockchain-based systems.

## Challenges we ran into 🔴💭🔒

- Encountering issues in Node JS with fetching form details from an HTML page, and seeking solutions to fix it.
- Experiencing instances where websites do not request for a MetaMask wallet if the user does not have one.
- Allowing execution of transactions even if the user does not have Ethereum, as there is no function implemented to check the balance of the MetaMask wallet.
- Seeking ways to address these challenges and ensure seamless functionality of the web application.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🎉🏆👏🔝

- When a block is added to the Hashgraph network, it creates an indelible and transparent record of the transaction.
- Utilizing Hashgraph in our web app enables us to complete transactions quickly, with transaction times that are 10 times faster than traditional blockchain technology.
- Hashgraph provides a high-speed and efficient consensus mechanism, allowing for rapid transaction processing and confirmation.
- The transparent and immutable nature of the Hashgraph network ensures the integrity and security of transaction records.

## What we learned 📚💡🔍

- Utilizing Hedera Network Service: You have gained knowledge and experience in deploying and utilizing the Hedera Network Service to build applications with high throughput and low-latency consensus finality. This can provide insights into leveraging distributed consensus algorithms for efficient transaction processing in your project.
- Building Transaction Web Apps: You have developed a transaction web app that is capable of executing transactions in real time and providing instant transaction confirmation details. This can indicate a strong understanding of web app development and integration with blockchain-based services.
- Scalability and Performance: Achieving a transaction processing speed of 10,000+ transactions per second showcases the potential of the Hedera Network Service for high throughput applications. Understanding how to design and optimize for scalability and performance in blockchain-based systems can be a valuable learning outcome.

## What's next for Hedera Transaction Web APP 🚀📈🔍

- The potential for this app is huge.
- First we intend to make sure that our entire codebase is secure and probably submit an audit.
- We could partner with various cryptos out there and get their content on our platform - a certain payment could be taken from these companies in their native tokens.
